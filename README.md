Project Name:  Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning and CNN
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

The goal of the "Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning and CNN" project is to create a reliable and precise predictive model for calculating an individual's probability of developing diabetes based on their health and medical information. Early diagnosis can dramatically improve patient outcomes and overall healthcare management for diabetes, a common and serious health condition. This study offers a useful example of utilizing machine learning for healthcare applications in addition to offering a workable method for early diabetes identification. It highlights how crucial data quality, model accuracy, interpretability, and ethical considerations are when applying AI to the field of medicine.

In this project, I am going to use ML algorithms such as KNN, Decision Tree, XG Boost, Random Forest, and CNN to provide the accuracy provided by these algorithms and show plots of comparison of data while working with each ML algorithm using Matplotlib and Seaborn. I have done a general data analysis and visualization of the dataset initially without any algorithm implementation as well.

The following components could be included in the deliverables for the project "Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning":

Codebase:
The collection of scripts, source code, and notebooks used for the construction and testing of models and the preprocessing of data.

Educated Models:
Saved model files or artifacts, including any pre-processing processes, for the learned machine-learning models.

Metrics of the project:
Provide the accuracy of the model earned through various machine learning algorithms and choose the algorithm with the highest accuracy.

DATASET USED
The dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is provided on Kaggle Website.

Tools Used: 
•	Numpy
•	Pandas
•	Scikit learn
•	Tensorflow
•	Keras
•	Matplotlib
•	Seaborn
